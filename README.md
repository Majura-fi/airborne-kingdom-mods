Boost your city's movement speed to lightning levels. The city's current speed is multiplied by `50` times and acceleration by `10` times.


## Infinite Storage

> Bigger on the inside!

Tired of running out of space? This mod removes storage limits, letting you hoard resources. The storage size is set to `100 000` units. It should not run out anytime soon.


## Minimum Resources

> Running on fumes, but never empty!

Your food, water, relics and coal will never drop below `50` units. For other resources, buy them from city markets. You might need to collect some resources first so resource amount gets updated.

Best when used together with the **Infinite Storage**.


## No Falling

> Defying gravity, permanently!

Your city will never fall out of the sky. Prevent fall calculation and set city's weight to near-zero.


## Reveal Map

> No more running circles!

Instantly uncover the entire map. Why should you be the only person in the whole city to spot things on the ground?
